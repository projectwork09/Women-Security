IMPLEMENTATION  OF BATTERY TO MAKE OUR PROTOTYPE MOVABLE - FOR REAL TIME DEMO

We were using AC-power supply for our project to work. But in phase-2 review-2 our teachers wanted it to be implemented as a werable device.
Hence now we are working on making it a werable-mobile device using inbuilt battery in our prototype and implementing the entire project in a women hand bag.
